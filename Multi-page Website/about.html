    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nick, and I am a student here at Lake Land College. I'm play a lot of video games in my free
         time. I also really like cats. I like coding as well, and am trying to create my own mod for a game. I am 
         also relatively decent at voice acting, and I have a lot of fun doing that. Yeah, not a whole not much more 
        than that</p>
