    <p>Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story was a game released for the Nintendo DS in 2009.
         It's a turn-based RPG where the player switches between controlling the Mario Bros. and Bowser. 
        This game normally is relatively easy for basically the entire game with some optional challeges
         here and there. This mod I'm making is designed to rebalance the stats of the enemies and make
         the game more challenging overall. At some point I want to modify some enemies' attacks
         and add more optional challenges as well.</p>
