            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nick. I am a student here at Lake Land College. I'm mainly into video games and other stuff like that.
                I work a part time job at a Walmart, and I really like cats. Yeah that's about it, I'm not very interesting.
            </p>
            <p>Giant nerd who knows way too much about the video games they like to play.</p>

                <h3>IT Programming Degree</h3>
                <p>I don't know if this actually counts, but I do hope to complete my Associate's
                    degree in IT Programming here at Lake Land College.

                <h3>Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story+</h3>
                <p>Currently extremely early in development, working title. A rom hack that aims
                    to rebalance the difficulty curve of Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, while
                    also hoping to add some new content to the game as well.
