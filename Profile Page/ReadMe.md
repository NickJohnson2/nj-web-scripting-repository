This contains a profile page that gives you a general summary of who I am, what I can do, and what I am currently working on.
There are a few nav button thats can take you places, either on the page or on a different page. There's an image at the top that shows some art that I've done. You can type text in a text box at the bottom.
Here's a screenshot of the page
